# string-matching-algorithms
This project implements 3 algorithms for pattern matching inside of strings.
The three algorithms, in run order
  1) Trivial Solution
  2) Booyer Moore
  3) Knuth-Morris-Pratt
 
In order to run this project, you must instert a txt.file name inside of the program.
After that you will run the program and it will prompt you to insert a search, upon
entering your query the three solutions will run and the out put of # of matches found, and time in microdeconds
is printed to console.

Happy Pattern Matching!
(Must have cmake Version 3.10 or higher)
