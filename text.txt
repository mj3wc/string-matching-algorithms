COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at
higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an
infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are 
in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community ("community spread") in many affected geographic areas. 
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
